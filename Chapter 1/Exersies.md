- [x] 1.2 Use \c in printf 
- [x] 1.3 Modify the temp program to print a heading above the table
- [x] 1.4 Write a program to print Celsius to Fah
- [ ] 1.5 Modify Temp Program to print the table in reverse order
- [ ] 1.6 Verify that the expression `getchar() !=EOF` is 0 or 1 (P17)
- [ ] 1.7 Write a program to print the value of EOF
- [ ] 1.8 Write a program to count blanks, tabs and newlines (P20)
- [ ] 1.9 Write a program to copy its input to its output replacing each string
          of one of more blanks by a single blank
- [ ] 1.10 Write a program to copy its input to its output replacing each tab by
           \t each backspace by \b and each backslash by \\.

           characters in its input
P 27
- [ ] 1.15 Rewrite the temp conversion program to use a function for conversion
P 30
- [ ] 1.16 Revise the main routine of the longest line program so it will
           correctly print the length of abitrarily long input lines as much as 
           possible of the text
- [ ] 1.17 Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 chars
- [ ] 1.18 Write a program to remove trailling balnks and tabs from each line of 
           input and to delete entirely blank lines
- [ ] 1.19 Write a `reverse(s)` that reverses the characters string s. Use it to
           write a program that reverses its input a line at a time.
P 34 
- [ ] 1.20 Write a program `detab` that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum
           number of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of
           tab stops, say every n cols, Should n be a variable or a symbolic param?
- [ ] 1.21 Write a program `entab` that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum 
           number of tabs needed to acheive the same spacing.

           like unbalanced parentheses, brakets and braces qoutes double qooutes and comments
           (hard)
